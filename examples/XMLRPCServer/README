The XML-RPC Server can be invoked by

python3 XMLRPCServer.py

and starts serving at port 8101 in the /RPC2 subdirectory.
The server implements two methods:

1) init()
2) run_cmd(<string>)
 
Calling the init() RPC will launch a remote Python shell 
that takes exclusive control of the hand and its peripherals.
The RPC run_cmd() takes a string of Python commands that will
be executed on the hand. 

Please be aware that this approach enables a malicious user
to run ANY Python code on the hand's embedded computer, so the
XML RPC server should only be used experimentally in safe, 
local networks at your own risk.

The file smarthand.urscript contains an example script for 
an Universal Robot arm (Polyscope), demonstrating opening
and closing the gripper by sending appropriate Python commands.
